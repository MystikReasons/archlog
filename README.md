# archlog

## Description
archlog is a simple Python CLI tool that fetches upgradable official Arch Linux packages and retrieves changelogs for each.
It distinguishes between minor and major Arch package updates.

* Minor updates usually contain only Arch-specific changes (e.g., rebuilds, packaging changes).
* Major updates include both Arch-specific commits and upstream version changes (e.g., new Firefox version).

Currently, only official Arch packages are supported. AUR, Flatpak, and other sources are not supported.

## Installation

You can either clone or download the repository manually:
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/MystikReasons/archlog.git"
```

Or download and extract via curl:
```bash
rm -rf archlog && curl -L "https://github.com/MystikReasons/archlog/archive/refs/heads/master.zip" -o "./archlog.zip" && unzip "./archlog.zip" -d "." && mv "archlog-master" "archlog" && rm -rf "./archlog.zip"
```

Move into the newly created directory:
```bash
cd archlog
```

Then install the tool using (`python-pipx` needs to be installed on your system):
```bash
pipx install .
```

You can now remove the `archlog` folder if you wish too.
```bash
rm -r archlog
```

Start the CLI with:
```bash
archlog
```

If the `archlog` command is not available after installation, your system might not have ~/.local/bin in its PATH.

To fix this, run:
```bash
pipx ensurepath
```

Then restart your terminal or run:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc depending on your shell
```

## Update

To update, you can download or pull the appropriate branch from this repository, and run the following command inside the downloaded archlog folder:
```bash
pipx install . --force
``` 

You can now remove the `archlog` folder if you wish too.
```bash
rm -r archlog
```

## Development Setup

> It is recommended to use a virtual environment for development.
